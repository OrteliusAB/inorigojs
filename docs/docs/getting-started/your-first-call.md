# Your first API call
Once you have installed and imported the InorigoJS library you can create a new API instance as seen below.

```html
<script>
const API = new inorigojs.InorigoAPI("https://www.myinorigo.com/")
const KSAPI = API.knowledgeset()
API.login("username", "password").then(() => {
    KSAPI.getTreeResult("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000").then((result) => {
        console.log(result.data)
    })
})
</script>
```

So what is going on here?

The InorigoJS object holds references to different utility classes, including the API class seen above, a data parser, entity factory, and so on. The API class has instance functions that return communication instances of each respective API of Inorigo, but with one shared root.
